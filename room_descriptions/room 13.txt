Samniteâ€™s Bunk

Several stands of armor with great shields standing beside them line the walls of this bunk. You recall coming here only once after your first year to meet with Julius, a veteran of the arena known as a samnite, for advice. He was a fierce combatant that combined great strength, heavy armor, and surprising speed to topple any foe. You are glad that he retired from the sport two years ago as he would have been a great foe. After your reminiscence you find it best to not tarry too long here as the samnites are likely to return to their home.
