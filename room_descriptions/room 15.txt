  Gate of Life
You have finally left the Hypogeum and now you stand beneath the arches of the Gate of Life and can see the arena. Many times have you stood before the great door that leads into the Colosseumâ€™s arena, but only now do you feel a strange sense of peace and apprehension. For past the Gate of Life lies freedom whether it be in death or life.
