Lanista’s Podium
A simple podium stands near the back wall of the room on an elevated platform. You remember well how before every major battle in the Colosseum that Felix would give a speech to rouse your team’s spirits. Though you once joined in cheering at his grand sentiments of glory, now you find yourself disgusted by his greed. Once you have been freed of this place Felix will face retribution by your hand, and you’ll be freed of the indignity of serving him.
