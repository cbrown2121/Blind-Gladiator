Felix’s Menagerie
Fine perfumes hang thick in the air covering the scent of rare beasts and you realize that you have found Felix’s private menagerie. Here he keeps his most valued and exotic of creatures for use in special events in the arena. You suppose your greatest foe was once housed here as the pens range in size from being able to house several wolves to a full-sized elephant. Curiously, one large pen with a placard reading “Regulus” is empty despite being well-kept and recently made. Perhaps Felix grew tired of the beast.
 
The strange gaggle of creatures all welcome you with indifference back to their home in Felix’s Menagerie.
