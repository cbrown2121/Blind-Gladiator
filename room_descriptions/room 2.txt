Goblin Den
A dark and cramped room designed for the cowardly and squat goblins brought back from a recent expedition into the unknown world. A great unease pervades this horrid, odorous place as you feel an opportunistic gaze coming from the shadows.
 
The goblinsâ€™ den as rank and vile as you remember.
