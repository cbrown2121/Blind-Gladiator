Communal Bunk
This room is a place that you remember quite well from your early days here as the communal bunk. A place where the new-bloods and the old guard on Felixâ€™s roster were expected to stay their nights and bond for team combat. As dark as it is you can spy no sleeping forms and yet you feel as though a blade could find your throat at any moment.
 
The seeming stillness of the communal bunk welcomes you.
 
Recruitable Ally could be found here
