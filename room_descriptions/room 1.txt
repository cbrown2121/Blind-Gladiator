Quintusâ€™ Room

Once decorated with finery and expensive silks and granted to you by Felix after becoming his star in the ring. After your fall from favor with the crowd your luxuries were taken from your room and replaced with a simple linen cot and blanket. Though to you it is still a welcome comfort from the fatigue of combat and woes of the world.
 
Your old room and haven from plight.
