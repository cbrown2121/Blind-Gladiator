Healer’s Room
The scent of sweet Narcissus and fine incense hangs gently upon the air. You’ve found your way to the old healer Adrian’s room where you’ve found yourself partaking of soothing tinctures and medicated poultices while convalescing from a rough battle. None would dare start a fight here before and now you feel that still holds true.

Old Adrian’s house of healing welcomes you once again.
