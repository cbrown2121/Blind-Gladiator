Venator’s Respite
As you enter the room you see the pelts of many exotic beasts line the walls and furniture, a mark of luxury and victory of a venator. Normally such finery would be reserved for the wealthy but a venator in Felix’s employ was allowed to keep a few specimens for themselves. They would come here with their favored trophy to lord their skill and strength over their fellows.
 
The eclectic collection of pelts before you signals your return to the Venator’s Respite.
