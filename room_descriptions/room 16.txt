The Arena
You stand upon the great circle of combat once more. Though the stands are empty you still hear the distant sound of cheering, outrage, and laughter. The sands of the arena are unbroken and still, a rarity in combat’s sacred space. In this quiet contemplation you find your resolve to secure your freedom steeled and end Felix’s life.
