Animal Pens
The musty odor of various creatures strikes your nose as you enter. It seems your journey has brought you to the animal pens where all manner of mundane beast is brought before a bout in the arena. The ground has become pitted in the center from dragging heavy beasts for a grand spectacle.
 
The musk of beasts still hangs heavy as you reenter the animal pens.
