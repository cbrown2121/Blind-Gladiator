Resting Area
You recognize this place as the communal rest area designed as a haven after long bouts of practice combat. You remember spending many days here over your career in the arena and the fond memories you had with your fellows on Felixâ€™s team. Though it is peaceful and safe it now seems that any mirth to be found is gone.
 
You find yourself missing your old friends as you enter the old rest area once more.
