Trophy Hall
You are greeted by the skull of the great rhinoceros that you slew several years ago as you enter the Colosseum’s trophy hall. A shrine created to commemorate the greatest bouts that its arena has held. Now though, it seems that the trophy that gave you great pride only exists to taunt you over now faded glory.
 
Your old foe’s skull looms in front of you in its emotionless taunt bores into your mind as you find your way back to the trophy room.
