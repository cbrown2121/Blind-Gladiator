Recruit’s Armory
As you enter the room you recognize it from your earliest days in the Colosseum as the armory for fresh recruits. Its equipment racks are sparse and most of what remains upon them are either in disrepair or are of no use to you.
 
The recruit’s armory still suffering its age as you return.
 
Maybe give the gladius aka sword a guaranteed spawn here
