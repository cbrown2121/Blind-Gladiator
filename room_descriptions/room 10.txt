Shrine of Mars
The lingering smell of heavy incense and burnt meats pervades the room you enter. At its center lies an altar bearing a statue of Mars, god of war, surrounded by offerings of wine and a small brazier for burnt offerings. You recall coming here before each of your battles to pray for glory and honor in the ring; a tradition many of your fellow combatants partook in.
 
Mighty Mars stands strong and greets you proudly as you return to his shrine.
