Regulus, Felix’s so-called lord of the arena, lies dead at your feet after your long battle. You begin to approach the owner’s stand where Felix currently stands his face locked in a look of shock and oncoming dread. He begins to run from his approaching death but trips over himself. As you close the distance, he cries out “Quintus! Stop! Please! I will give you anything that you desire. Freedom, wealth, women, and wine! Anything I can give will be yours; just name your price for my life!”

“My dignity.” Is your only reply to his shameful plea. A puzzled look overtakes Felix and with no further hesitation do you stab him in the heart with the dagger he gave you years ago. With his death you are now freed of your contract and can now go where you please. Perhaps you will sell some of Felix’s trophies and purchase a villa in the countryside or find work as a bodyguard. The End.
