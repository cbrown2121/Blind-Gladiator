You are known as Quintus a murmillo in the famed Colosseum of Rome owned and trained by the lanista Felix. After many years of competing in the arena you became the star of Felix’s roster and one of the favorites of the crowd. After your success Felix saw it fit to reward you with an ornamental dagger whose pommel is shaped as a roaring lion’s head. Recently, you have been suffering a worsening condition and started on a losing streak.

 It started with a subtle aching and lack of energy at critical moments in your duels, a factor you contributed to getting older. However, in your latest bout you found yourself stumbling and collapsed shortly after. In the following haze, you saw Felix arguing with several of the apothecaries complaining about an improper dosage and a ruined bet. They took you back to your room deep in the Hypogeum to privately administer treatment away from the knowing eyes of Adrian. Now that you have fully recovered you have decided to escape from the Colosseum and take revenge against Felix. Soon he will be nothing more than another of one of the Echoes of the Colosseum.
